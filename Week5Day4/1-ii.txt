Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Software Development:

i) Modularity and Reusability:
OOP organizes software into reusable components (objects), promoting modularity and reducing code redundancy. Objects encapsulate data and behaviors, which can be reused in different parts of the program or in other projects.

ii) Ease of Maintenance:
OOP improves software maintainability by isolating changes within objects. Modifications to one object do not affect others, reducing the risk of unintended side effects and making debugging and updates more straightforward.

iii)Scalability and Flexibility:
OOP supports scalability by allowing new objects and features to be added easily through inheritance and polymorphism. This flexibility enables the software to evolve and adapt to changing requirements without extensive modifications to existing code.
