Constructors in Java are special methods within a class designed to initialize objects when they are instantiated using the new keyword. 
Their primary role is to set initial values to the object's attributes, ensuring that the object starts in a valid state. Constructors 
are named identically to the class they belong to and do not have a return type, not even void. They are invoked implicitly when an 
object is created and can be overloaded to provide different ways of initializing objects with varying sets of parameters.

Example:

public class Car {
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, int year, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this.color = color;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota Camry", 2023, "Silver");
    }
}
